<!-- Introduction to Big Oh Notation --> 

1. Big Oh Notation - concerns functions defined on the "positive integers" 
  - We'll use the example 6n + T(n) = function on n = 1,2,3,...
  - We're going to be concerned about the "Worst Case" running time of an algorithm, as a function of the input size "n" 
  
2. What does it mean when we say a function T(n) is Big O of f(n), or hear f(n) is some basic function like nlogn 
  - What does it mean for a function to be Big O of f(n) - this means eventually for all sufficiently large values of n, it's bounded above by a constant multiple of f(n)
