<!-- Steps to Developing a Usable Algorithm -->

1. Model the problem: try to understand the main elements of the problem that needs to be solved 

2. Find an algorithm to solve it 

3. Is the algorithm fast enough? Does it fit in memory?

4. If not, figure out why

5. Find a way to address the problem 

6. Iterate until satisfied 

- This is a scientific approach to designing and analyzing algorithms, where we build mathematical models to try to understand what's going on - and then we do experiments to validate those models and help us improve things
