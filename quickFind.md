<!-- Quick-Find Algorithm to Solve Dynamic Connectivity Problem

  ## Steps to Developing a Usable Algorithm 
    1. Model the problem: try to understand the main elements of the problem that needs to be solved 

    2. Find an algorithm to solve it 

    3. Is the algorithm fast enough? Does it fit in memory?

    4. If not, figure out why

    5. Find a way to address the problem 

    6. Iterate until satisfied
