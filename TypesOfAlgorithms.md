When creating algorithms, we generally will follow a pattern 

  - We will Define a computational problem
  - We will say what the Input is 
  - We will say what the desired Output is
  - We will proceed to giving a solution, an ALGORITHM, that transforms the Input into the Output
  
  Integer Multiplication
  
  - Computational Problem: Integer Multiplication
   
  - What is the Input: Two n-digit numbers x and y 
    ** Think of "n" as a VERY large number
    
  - What is the desired output: The PRODUCT of x * y
  
  - The way will assess the PERFORMANCE of this algorithm, is through the number of basic operations that it performs 
  - Primitive Operation: in this case it is add or multiply
